# Lurk

Lurk is a light Twitch point harvester built with Bun and Svelte.

This project is based on [Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2), with a stronger focus on simplicity, efficiency, and performance.

Not all features are planned to be implemented right away. The current priority is reliable channel points mining and a clean, fast analytics UI.
